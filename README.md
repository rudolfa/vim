# vim
My vim configuration

# Install
This shell script install this vim configuration into ~/.vim-configs/main and links ~/.vim to it.

If you want to have multiple different vim configurations just create a new directory under ~/.vim-configs 
and create file vimrc and directory vim.

Switch with *swim* <tab>

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/rudolfa/vim.git/install.sh | bash
```

On Startup run ```:PackagerInstall```. It will install all the plugins.
